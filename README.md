# AI-Upload-Guard
A local pre-check tool that scans documents/spreadsheets/logs before you upload or paste them into AI tools or cloud services. It flags likely PII, secrets, code, network details, client/internal markers, and IP-like oddities and assigns a clear disposition so you can decide whether to redact, get approvals, or proceed.
